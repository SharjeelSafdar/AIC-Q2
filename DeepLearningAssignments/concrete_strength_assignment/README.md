<h1 align="center">DL Assignment: Concrete Strength Assignment (Regression)</h1>

## Problem Statement

Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength (concrete strength to bear the load) is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients.

Define and train a deep learning model to predict the compressive strength of concrete.
